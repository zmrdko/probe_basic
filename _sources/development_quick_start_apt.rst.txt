^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Download from: https://www.debian.org/download

    Select the Linux Debian 12 Bookworm Netinst CD ISO from the above link. You will need to make a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive depending on how you plan to install. The below software is extremely easy and works flawlessly with Linux Debian OS images:

    Once you have created your flash stick for LinuxCNC, proceed to install and boot the system. (Note: It is advised to have an ethernet cable internet connection during install). Select the graphical installation option. Follow the steps on screen to complete installation. When you are greeted by the Linux Desktop Selection Page, uncheck the GNOME option and check the XFCE4 option.

2. Update the System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    After installation, run the following commands in the main terminal:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade

3. Install LinuxCNC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    If you have not already installed LinuxCNC from apt, use the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install linuxcnc-uspace linuxcnc-uspace-dev mesaflash

    Once you have installed LinuxCNC, open it and start the axis sim briefly and then shut it down to ensure the installation was successful.

4. Add the APT Repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Run the following commands in the main terminal one at a time:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install curl
        echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://repository.qtpyvcp.com/apt develop main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kcjengr.list
        curl -sS https://repository.qtpyvcp.com/repo/kcjengr.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kcjengr.gpg
        gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key 2DEC041F290DF85A

5. Update the Repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt update

6. Install QtPyVCP and Probe Basic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install python3-qtpyvcp
        sudo apt install python3-probe-basic

    You are now installed! You should be able to launch the Probe Basic sim from within the LinuxCNC applications dropdown menu.

Updating and Configuration
--------------------------

    Updating of Probe Basic and QtPyVCP will occur when you run the normal "sudo apt update, sudo apt upgrade" commands. During updating, the Probe Basic sim configuration files will be overwritten. It is strongly recommended to create your machine configuration files with unique names to avoid having them overwritten during updates.
